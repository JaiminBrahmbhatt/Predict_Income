# Predict_Income
Predict a person's income using Sklearn tool and object oriented programming technique in Python

Assumptions:

1. Training dataset: Adult Data Set available from UCI https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult

2. Testing dataset: adult.test.txt also available from UCI

3. Binary classification for outcome: the person either makes <=50K or >50K annually


Project is completed with 4 processes:

1. Data Preparation: Download, extract, clean and store the data >>> Result: adult.csv, cleanData.csv and cleanData.sqlite

2. Data Exploration: Visualize the distribution of each variable and also their relationships with income outcome >>> Result: All the PNG pictures

3. Data Modeling: Create predictive model using logistic regression and improve with random forest classifier

4. Prediction: Transform the test data to feed in the predictive model


Running this program is simple as 1,2,3:

1. Pull/download this repo

2. Make sure you have Python 2, Numpy, Pandas and Sklearn modules

3. Run the Main.py script (browse to the project directory and run command python Main.py)
